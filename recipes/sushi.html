    <h1>Sushi Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Sushi is probably my favorite type of food. It is healthy, 
            fun to eat, and (most importantly) delicious. I didn't 
            like sushi as a kid because I was freaked out by the 
            idea of eating raw fish. In college, my wife told me I 
            needed to branch out, so I tried a California roll for 
            first time, and it slowly grew on me. Fast forward nearly 
            10 years later, and I chose Nobu in Newport Beach for my 
            30th birthday celebration dinner (would highly recommend 
            by the way).</p>

        <p>If you've read any of my other <a href="czech-dumplings.html">articles</a>, 
            you'll probably already know that I am no Michelin Star chef. 
            My wife once told me I should try out for the popular reality TV 
            cooking show "Worst Cooks in America." All jokes aside, I've never 
            worried about my lack of cooking skills because I prefer to 
            focus on other skills instead. However, when I became a dad, 
            I suddenly felt a great fear of being the father who couldn't 
            cook a nice meal for his family. Sure, I'd love to have my 
            wife's cooking every day for the rest of my life, and I would 
            ie a happy man, but I didn't want to be a man who is completely 
            incapable of preparing a nice meal for my family every so often. 
            So I decided to learn to make sushi, because it seemed like a 
            challenge, and I was curious to see how the sushi chefs actually 
            prepare those tuna rolls for us behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>After much trial and error, watching a bunch of cooking shows, 
            and making sushi several times, I have compiled the following 
            recipe for making delicious sushi rolls.</p>
