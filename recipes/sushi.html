    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Sushi is probably my favorite type of food. It is healthy, 
            fun to eat, and (most importantly) delicious. I didn't 
            like sushi as a kid because I was freaked out by the 
            idea of eating raw fish. In college, my wife told me I 
            needed to branch out, so I tried a California roll for 
            first time, and it slowly grew on me. Fast forward nearly 
            10 years later, and I chose Nobu in Newport Beach for my 
            30th birthday celebration dinner (would highly recommend 
            by the way).</p>

        <p>If you've read any of my other <a href="czech-dumplings.html">articles</a>, 
            you'll probably already know that I am no Michelin Star chef. 
            My wife once told me I should try out for the popular reality TV 
            cooking show "Worst Cooks in America." All jokes aside, I've never 
            worried about my lack of cooking skills because I prefer to 
            focus on other skills instead. However, when I became a dad, 
            I suddenly felt a great fear of being the father who couldn't 
            cook a nice meal for his family. Sure, I'd love to have my 
            wife's cooking every day for the rest of my life, and I would 
            die a happy man, but I didn't want to be a man who is completely 
            incapable of preparing a nice meal for his family every so often. 
            So I decided to learn to make sushi, because it seemed like a 
            challenge, and I was curious to see how the sushi chefs actually 
            prepare those tuna rolls for us behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>After much trial and error, watching a bunch of cooking shows, 
            and making sushi several times, I have compiled the following 
            recipe for making delicious sushi rolls.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <p>Serves 4 people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sushi rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sushi vinegar</li>
            <li>sushi seaweed paper</li>
            <li>meat for rolls (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, smelt eggs, 
                imitation crab, lobster, unagi, blue fin, etc)</li>
            <li>other vegetables/etc to add into rolls 
                (cucumber, carrot, tamago, cream cheese, tempura, etc)</li>
            <li>spicy japanese mayo</li>
            <li>pickled ginger</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash the rice at least 3 times and strain until the water runs clear</li>
            <li>Cook 3 cups of rice in a rice cooker</li>
            <li>When rice is finished, add 3 cups of sushi vinegar to the rice, sprinkle evenly </li>
            <li>Toss the rice to evenly disperse the sushi vinegar</li>
            <li>Make a ball of rice the size of a baseball</li>
            <li>Shape the ball of rice into the shape of a cylinder</li>
            <li>Place the cylinder of rice on a piece of sushi seaweed paper</li>
            <li>Using your fingertips, gently push the rice to the edges of the seaweed paper, 
                until the entire paper is evenly covered with rice. Be careful not to tear the 
                paper. Feel free to add more rice onto the seaweed if necessary</li>
            <li>Flip over the seaweed paper with the rice on it so that the rice is facing downwards 
                and the blank seaweed side is face upwards </li>
            <li>Evenly spread some spicy Japanese mayo on the blank side of the seaweed paper</li>
            <li>Cut the sushi meat into long, relatively thin pieces</li>
            <li>Place the long strips of meat on top of the surface that 
                has the mayo on it. Place the strips of meat close together and in the 
                middle of the seaweed paper to make it easier to roll</li>
            <li>Add any vegetables or other desired ingredients along side the meat</li>
            <li>Carefully roll the seaweed paper around the meat and other ingredients to 
                wrap them up inside the sushi roll. This may take some practice at first, 
                but it's easy once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Cover the sushi roll with plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Use a sushi roller to pack the sides of the roll, and gently compress the 
                roll to make it all pack together nicely</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic wrap</li>
            <li>If you are using smelt eggs or any rice seasoning, place some on the 
                surface you are rolling the sushi on, and roll the sushi roll over the 
                smelt eggs or rice seasoning to make a nice layer of the toppings on the 
                roll</li>
            <li>Using a large cooking knife, carefully cut the roll into 8 pieces. It 
                helps to wet the blade with water before cutting the roll to make the 
                cut more smooth and precise</li>
            <li>Serve with a side of wasabi, pickled ginger, and a light soy sauce</li>
        </ol>

        <p>*Optional recommendation: Real wasabi root. This can usually be 
            found in authentic Japanese supermarkets, but not all of them 
            carry it. It is very expensive due to lack of supply in 
            Japan, but the taste is absolutely worth it. Most people are 
            unaware that the standard wasabi included with most dishes at 
            restaurants and with grocery-bought sushi is basically 
            horseradish with some wasabi flavoring, and it is nothing close 
            to the real thing. The reason for this is the expense, and most 
            customers are not interesting in paying extra just to have 
            a different kind of spicy sauce with their meal. However, if you 
            are lucky enough to find the true wasabi root, I would highly 
            recommend trying it at least once. It is a fun experience 
            to grate the wasabi into a paste, and it can make for a fun party 
            feature if you are hosting guests.</p>

            <p>*Note: Please follow all safety guidelines regarding the 
                consumption of raw meats or other uncooked ingredients 
                to ensure your safety and the safety of your guests</p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
