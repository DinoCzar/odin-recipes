    <h1>Shuǐ Jiǎo Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I first came across shuǐ jiǎo (水餃) when my wife was taking me on 
            a journey through Chinese cuisine. As you can probably tell if you've 
            read any other articles on this site, she has basically been my guide 
            through most of my food journey. Shuǐ jiǎo, which literally translates 
            to water dumplings, are very popular in Taiwan, China, and much of Asia. 
            They quickly became one of my favorite foods to order at Chinese 
            restaurants, and I wanted to impress my wife by learning how to order them 
            in her native tongue. This was where the trouble began.</p>

        <p>A little background, my wife is fluent in Mandarin, and I took a 
            language class in college trying to pick up a few phrases. It was the 
            only class that I nearly failed, and without her help, I surely would have 
            been defeated. After I became a little more comfortable with some simple 
            words, I would practice speaking Chinese by attempting to order off the 
            menu at restaurants. More than once, I tried ordering shuǐ jiǎo dumplings 
            (水餃), but I accidentally said "shuì jiào" (睡覺), which means "to sleep."</p>

            <p>So the waitress had asked me, "你要什麼" ("What would you like to order?"), 
            and I replied: "我要睡覺," which means "I want to sleep." The poor girl looked 
            at me with a look of complete confusion, to which my wife giggled and politely 
            corrected the order. This was not the last time this happened to me, nor was it
            even close to my most embrassing moment in my journey studying Chinese. To this 
            day, I still routinely mix up words or say something in the wrong context that 
            can return a strange look, but it's all part of the ball game. Similarly, you 
            may struggle to make these dumplings look perfect, or they may fall apart if 
            you haven't properly shaped the dough, but the most important thing is to have 
            fun and enjoy the ride. Good luck with your 水餃! (not 睡覺...)</p>

        <p>This recipe is from my mother-in-law, and she makes some of the 
            best 水餃 I've ever had. She had a business idea of opening a 
            dumpling shop in Whistler (more as a retirement hobby), and I'm 
            sure it would have taken off. There's nothing like warm dumplings 
            after a long day of skiing. Well...except for maybe some poutine...
            but we'll leave it at that. If these dumplings are good enough to 
            fill me up after a long day of powder and double diamonds, they 
            are good enough for any occasion you are likely to come across.</p>
