    <h1>Czech Dumplings Recipe</h1>

        <img src="images/dumplings.jpg" alt="Czech Dumplings">

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Czech dumplings recipe has been passed down 
        for many generations in my family. My grandmother 
        left me this recipe, and I consider it to be of great 
        sentimental value. She said that it was her grandma 
        Mamie's, which means that this recipe is from my 
        great, great, grandmother.</p>

        <p>I do not know the proper name for this dish, 
        in fact, I'm not even entirely sure that this dish 
        is technically of Czech origin. In my research, 
        I discovered a Nordic meal called potato klubb, 
        which appears to be nearly identical to these dumplings. 
        However, one year, my family did a DNA test for fun, 
        and it proved that there were no Norwegian ties on my 
        grandma's side. Instead, she was mostly of Germanic 
        European descent, which is where the Czech side comes from.</p>

        <p>There are many variations of European dumpling dishes.
        For example, Kn√∂del are boiled dumplings that have ties 
        to German, Czech, Austrian, and Slovak cuisine. They are 
        definitely slightly different than potato klubb in that they often 
        contain meat, plums, apricots, bread, egg yolk, etc, but
        they are similar in the simplicity of the recipes and use 
        of potatoes. I digress, the recipe card that my grandma gave 
        me is titled "My Grandma's Czech Dumplings," so I will 
        assume that these are authentic Czech dumplings, and will
        refer to them as such.</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, my Mom would make this dish for 
        holidays and special occasions. She would serve the dumplings
        simply with butter, and I always loved them. Later in life, my 
        wife and I were visiting my parents, and we decided to have the 
        dumpling dish for dinner one night. My wife, who is part 
        Taiwanese, was excited to try the dumplings. She had 
        thoughts of flavorful Xiao Long Bao, Xiao Mai, or maybe 
        at least something like gyoza. She was expecting a soft, 
        doughy outside with some delicious pork, 
        chicken, or maybe even crab or shrimp on the inside. I don't 
        think she was prepared for the Czech potato dumplings that my 
        ancestors weathered harsh winters with. It was a surprise for her, 
        but a delicous one! We laughed and everyone enjoyed their dinner. 
        The truth is, my wife is absolutely the foody of the family. 
        She is an incredible cook. Aside from making a sandwich or 
        whipping up some burgers for dinner, I am generally useless in 
        the kitchen. I guess, I did learn to make sushi recently, but that 
        is a story for another article. </p>
        
        <p>If you are looking to try a traditional European dumpling 
        dish, then you've come to the right place!</p>
